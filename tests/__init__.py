"""
Initialize the tests package.
This allows Python to treat the tests folder as a package,
making imports from the main codebase cleaner.

# No code needed here for pytest to discover tests
# You can optionally set up common fixtures or imports for all tests

# Example: common imports for all test modules
# import pytest
# from data_miner.data_cleaner import DataCleaner
